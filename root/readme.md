**Steps**:
	
	1. Clone the repository, using :
	`git clone https://github.com/roshnet/echelon-transform`

	2. `cd` to the cloned directory.

	3. Create and activate a virtual environment (if not already), and get the required Python modules installed by running in the terminal:
		`sudo apt install python3-pip`
		and
		`pip3 install flask`

	4. Make sure that the active directory in the terminal/venv is `echelon-transform`, and run `export FLASK_APP=echelon.py` to set Flask environment variable.
	P.S: Run `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` after the last command to enable debug-mode.
	
	5. Simply run the application by executing `flask run` in the terminal from the same directory. 

	6. Ready to go! Start the localhost in the browser to use the application.
